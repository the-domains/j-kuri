## Love Coffee and Sharing Ideas?

J-kuri has some big projects for 2016\. The Ginkgo Alliance is our private mastermind which we established in January 2015\. We're currently inviting a few new members to join the Alliance. If you're an up and coming entrepreneur who likes to meet with likeminded people regularly over coffee then you might be a good fit for our group. Numbers are strictly limited. 

Our Open Day (evening) is planned for April 9th. We have booked a large table at a beautiful restaurant on the 6th floor of the Grand Front Kita building. Come and meet us, find out what we're all about and learn how we can help you to reach higher business goals this year.   
Reservations are being taken through our [bookings page ][0].
